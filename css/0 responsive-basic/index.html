      <!-- potrait = height use  -->

      <!-- responsive means to fit according to their device like landscape to potrait or potrait to landescape.  -->

      <!-- units in code  -->

      <div id="units">
        <h1>Understanding the units</h1>
        <!-- px -->
        <p>
          1. px [pixels] = it is fixed it can not be change if you make your
          screen small or big .
        </p>

        <!-- % [percentage ] =  it means parent ke kitna guna h   -->

        <p>
          2. % = it depend or relative to the parent and takes height width
          according to parent. percentage used in height and width.
        </p>

        <!-- vw and vh [ viewport height and viewport width ]-->

        <p>
          3. vw and vh [ viewport height and viewport width ] = it means it
          depend on their full screen . and takes action according their screen
          size and it moves according their screen.
        </p>

        <!-- vmax and vmin [viewport maximum and viewport minimum ]  -->

        <p>
          4. vmax and vmin [viewport maximum and viewport minimum ] = vmin is
          the minimum between the viewport's height or width in percentage
          depending on which is smaller. vmax is the maximum between the
          viewport's height or width in percentage depending on which is bigger.
          These units can change when the browser window is resized or the
          orientation of a mobile phone changes. <br />
          ex- if we give a txt 5vmax it adjust their and width to 5vmax , it do
          not go smaller or it stops resposivenss and it takes responsives to vw
          or vh units auto and takes their 5vmax value same means their size be
          only 5vmax but it fit both according to their height and width. .
        </p>

        <!-- em and rem -->

        <p>
          em and rem = <br />
          em is relative or depend to the font-size of its direct or nearest
          parent. means we give parent 30px unit and give their child 1em it
          takes 1em = 30px. font size is manadtory to give parent and use em in
          their child.

          <br />

          rem is relative to the HTML (root) font-size . means it takes size
          their all screen size . 1 rem = 16px.
