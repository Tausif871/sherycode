  <!-- position absolute  - it makes layer if we give posotion absolute all of cars names div , absolute always seen from the top which means if we have order in 1 2 3 so if we see from top we see 3 2 1 . and position absolute can freely move any where we want .  -->

  <!-- ex -  if we see green means it is first layer and we see red means it is second layer and aslo we see black it is third layer . thats exactly is seen from top always remember  -->

  <!-- <div id="car1"></div>
  <div id="car2"></div>
  <div id="car3"></div> -->


  <!-- position relative - it means the elemets are moves freely in position reletaive parent sapce and it does not go out from parent space . it is not like absolute . -->
