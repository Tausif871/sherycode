//var const and let

// what is keyword ?
// keyword is a reserverd word in programming language that have meaning and we can not use it for your own purpose.

// js connected with chorme memory and chrome connects to the ram memory.

// variable - it is a container that store data.

// var, let and const are keyword that we say computer that we want to store some values.

var dulha = "lab";
var dulhan = "laby";

console.log(dulha + "weds" + dulhan);

var dulha = "haramzada";

console.log(dulha + "weds" + dulhan);

// let - it is also like var but it has 



// const - if we assign a value and want tochange the value, it shows us error means if  we assign a value it premanent hold the space and doesn't remove or change once we assign it.

const dulha1 = "lab";
const dulhan1 = "laby";

console.log(dulha + "weds" + dulhan);


// types  ----

// primitive and reference types .

// primitive values -- aisi value jinko copy krne pr real value copy hogi.

// reference values - aise values jinko copy karne pr parent ka reference copy hoga.


// ex - 

// primitive

var a = 12;
var b = a;

var b = b + 2;

console.log(b);


// reference 

var arr = [1,2,3,4];

var br = arr;

br.pop();


// Interpreter and compiler --


// js langauge use english words and computers does not understand english it understand 0 and 1, in other words we  can say that current-flow or current-bypass, 

// we want to write in english and computer understand and we do this we use a translator that conver it to o and 1.

// english --> translator ---> 0 & 1.

// compiler and interpreter are translaror that converts our english code to machine code.

/* 

Interpreter --  Interpreter converts our code into byte code but its conversion rate is faster than machine code. byte code runs slower than machine code and after conversion byte code it again convert to machine code.


compiler -- compiler converts our code into machine code, machine code is faster but it has slower conversion rate. 


// what we have to use ?

// we do not have chioce , by default js have and run on interpreter.

// jit compiler -- it was develped by google, it uses capabilities of starting phase of interpreter and then it uses compiler capabilities of  running phase and makes faster with both combination.

// window --- window is a collection of all of the tools which are available in the browser  and given by the browser to use in the JavaScript.  like - console, document, alert, prompt etc.

// in other words, there are many features which are frequently used in js and they are not the part of js, they are not the part of the jS but they are available in the browser when you use them in js they are called from the browesr not js.


// go to developer mode  ---> got to console --> type window and it shows all the functions that are part of browser.


// ex - window is a bucket that  have all tools and that tools so that tools are provided by the browser to javascript to use them and all these features  which are made available via browser are put inside window.
